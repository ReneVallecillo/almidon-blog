III  Requirements

1. Apache 2.x + (with Rewrite module actived)
2. Smarty 2.x +
3. PostgreSQL 8.x +

IV   Installation

1. Run the SQL script *almidon_blog.sql*

2. Move the *phps* directory content to a apache public directory, if you already have a web site in that directory I recommend you to put it all together in a folder, for example blog.

3. Move the *tpls* directory content to the existent template dir, where Smarty has access, again I recommend if you have other TPLs or template files put it all together in a folder, and put the same name as the previous name you used in the previous point.

4. Move the content of *classes* directory of this project to the classes of the website. 

5. Edit classes/tables.class.php and after the last line put

include 'blog.class.php';

6. Edit classes/config.php and after the last line put

include 'blog.config.php';

ln -s ../almidon_blog/tpls path-to-tpl-dir/blog
ln -s ../almidon_blog/phps path-to-public-dir/blog
